hey now everything is good, FIRST REMEMBER THAT TULIKUWA TUNAPATA FIREBASE IS NOT INITIALIZED ERROR IN OUR CONSOLE BUT NOW AFTER WHEN I RUN MY CODE I SEE ANOTHER ERROR OF 
"java.io.IOException: FIS_AUTH_ERROR in Android Firebase" BY SEEING THIS ERROR NIKAPATA MOYO KUWA OK NOW FIREBASE HAS BEEN INITIALIZED BUT THERE ARE SOMETHING ELSE MAKE ME 
UNABLE TO ACCESS FIREBASE SERVICES, THEN I GO TO THIS ARTICLE IN STACK OVERFLOW 
https://stackoverflow.com/questions/60698622/java-io-ioexception-fis-auth-error-in-android-firebase
KWANZA KITU CHA KUSHANGAZA NA KUJUA KUWA FIREBASE IMEKUWA INITIALIZED NI KWAMBA NILIVYOENDA KWENYE MY GOOGLE CLOUD CONSOSE I IN THE LIST OF SERVICES AND API ENABLED I SEE THE
FIREBASE HAS BEEN ACCESSED BY THERE IS "100" errors then i know ok now my project has initalized the firebase, ooh i said THANK YOU GOD, NOW I CONTINUE TO DEBUGG
NOW I FIND THE ANSWER IS THAT THE API I'VE LINKED IN google-services.json has not been enabled to use the firebase services, I go to my account in the google console and look  
at that ENABLED_API >> CREDETIALS >> CLICK API YOU'VE FOUND IN YOU google-services.json AND SOMETIMES BY DEFAULT ITS NAME HAS "ENABLED BY FIREBASE" THEN WHAT NEXT IS THAT I 
LOOK IT AND CLICK EDIT THEN I GO TO RESTRICT API AND ADD THE FOLLOWING SERVICES TO BE ACCESSED BY THAT API...
this is a list of services i enabled to make my api access the firebase services 
    1. cloud messaging
    2. fcm registration api
    3. firebase app distribution api
    4. firebase dynamic links api
    5. firebase hosting api
    6. firebase installation api
    7. firebase management api
    8. firebase remote config api
    9. firebase remote config realtime api
    10. firebase cloud messaging api

by enabling this services now everything is good thank you god also make sure that 
you don't pass the PROJECT_ID when you fetch push token use expo..
WHAT I'VE LEARN IS THAT SOMETIMES IT TAKES TIME FOR FIREBASE TO BE CONFIGURED AND TO BE ENABLED AS THE 
SERVICE IN YOUR GOOGLE CLOUD CONSOLE JUST CHILL OR YOU SHOULD GO AND ENABLE THE SERVICE
JUST ENABLE FIREBASE SERVICE IN YOUR GOOGLE CLOUD CONSOSE IF ITS NOT ENABLED EVEN AFTER SIGNING USING THE FIREBASE
