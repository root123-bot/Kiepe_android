{/* in order to have the ability to drag up down the bottom sheet it we must wrap full component using the 
      GestureHandlerRootView you can do that here or if you want all component to mutate the same prop you can
      wrap full App.js root component with GestureHandlerRootView so as to have the gesture in all component for
      me let me do it here, the documentation of the "BottomSheet" forgot to tell us about this issue
      for now thank you github issues solved this
      I don't know why the BottomSheet at Map.js worked without wrapping with this <GestureHandlerRootView> 
      but i think it because of Map has drag and other gestures enabled... BUT I THINK ITS BETTER APPROACH TO WRAP
      THIS <GestureHandlerRootView /> in our App.js to avoid wrapping everytime to the component we want to have the 
      gesture events... so i'm going to wrap in App.js
