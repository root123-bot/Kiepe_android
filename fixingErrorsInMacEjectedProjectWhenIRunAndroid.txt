npm run android error .. unable to locate JAVA_HOME what should i do i should specify the JAVA_HOME
location and by default we should use the one provided by Android Studio
on my mac the JAVA_HOME is located on /Applications/Android\ Studio.app/Contents/jbr/Contents/Home 
so to fix this in ur project run 
JAVA_HOME=/Applications/Android/\ Studio.app/Contents/jbr/Contents/Home

also we have android home of 
ANDROID_HOME="/Users/macbookair/Library/Android/sdk"

just include 
  dependencies {
       implementation 'com.github.CanHub:Android-Image-Cropper:4.5.0'
  }
and add this "jcenter()" to your dependencies

i hardcoded values of BuildConfig.IS_HERMES_ENABLED to "true" and for BuildConfig.IS_NEW_ARCHITECTURE_ENABLED to "false" after failed to solve them 

also i found in some case i have different package.. for expmle in ReactNativeFlipper.java it import package "com.kihepe"
also in android/build.gradle i see namespace is "com.kihepe" they said in some case if things not working make sure you have 
the same package name for me is "com.mweuc654.Kiepe"... error of failed to import R solved by this counter measure
if found this is this thread.. https://github.com/expo/expo/issues/21784


        What worked for me was to make sure that the namespace in android/app/build.gradle was correct and then run ./gradlew clean and then run the android app again.

        For some reason the namespace generated with expo prebuild was wrong.

        I.e. My MainApplication.java file was located in com/company/app folder so the namespace should be com.company.app.
