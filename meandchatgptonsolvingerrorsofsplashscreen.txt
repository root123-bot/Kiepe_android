how to put splash screen in expo react native bare minimum

ChatGPT
To add a splash screen to your Expo React Native app, you can follow these steps:

Create a splash screen image:
First, prepare a splash screen image that you want to display when the app loads. The image should have the appropriate dimensions for different screen sizes and densities. Common sizes are 1242x2688 pixels for iOS and 720x1280 pixels for Android. Name the image "splash.png" for iOS and "splash.png" for Android.
Add the splash screen image to your project:
Place the splash screen image in the root directory of your project. You can put it in a folder called "assets" or directly in the project's root.
Install the necessary dependencies:
If you haven't already, make sure you have Expo CLI installed globally on your machine. If not, install it with the following command:
Copy code
npm install -g expo-cli
Configure the splash screen in your app:
Open your "app.json" file in the root directory of your project. Add the following configuration to set up the splash screen:
json
Copy code
{
  "expo": {
    "splash": {
      "image": "./splash.png",
      "resizeMode": "contain",
      "backgroundColor": "#ffffff"
    }
  }
}
Here, you specify the image path, "resizeMode" sets how the image should be displayed on different screen sizes, and "backgroundColor" sets the background color behind the splash screen image.
Run your app:
Now, run your Expo app using the following command:
sql
Copy code
expo start
Expo will automatically detect the splash screen configuration in your app.json and display the splash screen image when the app is launched.
That's it! Now your Expo React Native app should display the splash screen whenever it starts up.

how to put the splash screen in expo bare minimum react native

ChatGPT
In Expo, there's a differentiation between "Managed" and "Bare" workflows. A "Bare" workflow means you have more control over the native code and dependencies, while a "Managed" workflow means you rely more on the Expo client.

If you are using the "Bare" workflow, setting up a splash screen requires a bit more manual configuration compared to the "Managed" workflow. Here's how you can add a splash screen in Expo Bare minimum React Native:

Create a splash screen image:
Prepare a splash screen image that you want to display when the app loads. The image should have appropriate dimensions for different screen sizes and densities. Common sizes are 1242x2688 pixels for iOS and 720x1280 pixels for Android. Name the image "splash.png" for iOS and "splash.png" for Android.
Add the splash screen image to your project:
Place the splash screen image in the respective folders:
For iOS, place the image in the ios directory of your project under the Assets.xcassets folder.
For Android, place the image in the android/app/src/main/res/drawable directory of your project.
Configure the splash screen in native code:
You'll need to modify the native code to display the splash screen correctly during app launch. The process is slightly different for iOS and Android:
For iOS:
In Xcode, open your project's AppDelegate.m file, and add the following code inside the didFinishLaunchingWithOptions method:
objective
Copy code
#import "AppDelegate.h"
#import <React/RCTBridge.h>
#import <React/RCTBundleURLProvider.h>
#import <React/RCTRootView.h>

@implementation AppDelegate

- (BOOL)application:(UIApplication *)application didFinishLaunchingWithOptions:(NSDictionary *)launchOptions
{
  // ... existing code ...

  // Add the splash screen code
  UIView *splashScreen = [[UIImageView alloc] initWithImage:[UIImage imageNamed:@"splash"]];
  splashScreen.frame = self.window.bounds;
  [self.window addSubview:splashScreen];
  [self.window bringSubviewToFront:splashScreen];

  // ... existing code ...

  return YES;
}

@end
For Android:
Open your project's MainActivity.java file and add the following code inside the onCreate method:
java
Copy code
package com.yourprojectname;

import android.os.Bundle;
import com.facebook.react.ReactActivity;
import android.view.View;
import android.widget.ImageView;

public class MainActivity extends ReactActivity {
    @Override
    protected void onCreate(Bundle savedInstanceState) {
        super.onCreate(savedInstanceState);

        // Add the splash screen code
        ImageView splashScreen = new ImageView(this);
        splashScreen.setImageResource(R.drawable.splash);
        splashScreen.setScaleType(ImageView.ScaleType.CENTER_CROP);
        setContentView(splashScreen);

        // ... existing code ...
    }

    // ... existing code ...
}
Build and run your app:
After making these changes, you can build and run your app on a device or emulator to see the splash screen in action.
Remember that with the "Bare" workflow, you have more control over the native code, but you are also responsible for managing dependencies and updating them manually. Be sure to check Expo's documentation for any updates or changes to their workflow.

cannot find symbol
    ImageView splashScreen = new ImageView(this);
    ^
  symbol:   class ImageView
  location: class MainActivity

ChatGPT
Apologies for the confusion. In a bare minimum React Native project, the ImageView class is not directly accessible like in a standard Android project because Expo doesn't expose it in the JavaScript environment.

To implement a splash screen in a bare minimum React Native project, you should use the native approach without using the ImageView class in Java.

Here's the correct way to set up a splash screen for an Expo Bare React Native project on Android:

Create a splash screen image: Prepare a splash screen image (e.g., splash.png) with the appropriate dimensions for different screen sizes.
Add the splash screen image to your project: Place the image in the android/app/src/main/res/drawable directory of your project.
Configure the splash screen in native code: Open your project's MainActivity.java file and update the onCreate method to set up the splash screen:
java
Copy code
package com.yourprojectname;

import android.os.Bundle;
import com.facebook.react.ReactActivity;
import android.view.Window;
import android.view.WindowManager;
import android.widget.ImageView;

public class MainActivity extends ReactActivity {
    @Override
    protected void onCreate(Bundle savedInstanceState) {
        super.onCreate(savedInstanceState);

        // Hide the status bar (optional, to make the splash screen look better)
        requestWindowFeature(Window.FEATURE_NO_TITLE);
        getWindow().setFlags(WindowManager.LayoutParams.FLAG_FULLSCREEN, WindowManager.LayoutParams.FLAG_FULLSCREEN);

        // Set the splash screen image
        ImageView splashScreen = new ImageView(this);
        splashScreen.setImageResource(R.drawable.splash);
        splashScreen.setScaleType(ImageView.ScaleType.CENTER_CROP);
        setContentView(splashScreen);

        // ... existing code ...
    }

    // ... existing code ...
}
Build and run your app: After making these changes, build and run your app on an Android device or emulator to see the splash screen.
Remember that when using the bare workflow, you are responsible for managing dependencies and updates manually. Be sure to check Expo's documentation for any updates or changes to their workflow.

        LinearLayout layout = new LinearLayout(this);
        layout.setLayoutParams(new LinearLayout.LayoutParams(LinearLayout.LayoutParams.MATCH_PARENT, LinearLayout.LayoutParams.MATCH_PARENT));
        layout.addView(splashScreen);
        setContentView(layout);

        // ... existing code ...
    }

    // ... existing code ...
}
Build and run your app: After making these changes, build and run your app on an Android device or emulator to see the splash screen.
Again, I apologize for the confusion earlier. This updated code should help you set up the splash screen correctly in your bare minimum React Native project.

ChatGPT
Apologies for the oversight. The requestWindowFeature method is specific to activities that extend android.app.Activity, not ReactActivity. Since React Native uses a different approach for rendering and handling UI, you don't need to use requestWindowFeature in a bare minimum React Native project.

Here's the corrected implementation for the splash screen without using requestWindowFeature:

Create a splash screen image: Prepare a splash screen image (e.g., splash.png) with the appropriate dimensions for different screen sizes.
Add the splash screen image to your project: Place the image in the android/app/src/main/res/drawable directory of your project.
Configure the splash screen in native code: Open your project's MainActivity.java file and update the onCreate method to set up the splash screen:
java
Copy code
package com.yourprojectname;

import android.os.Bundle;

import android.widget.LinearLayout;
import android.widget.LinearLayout.LayoutParams;

public class MainActivity extends ReactActivity {
    @Override
    protected void onCreate(Bundle savedInstanceState) {
        super.onCreate(savedInstanceState);

        // Set the splash screen image
        ImageView splashScreen = new ImageView(this);
        splashScreen.setImageResource(R.drawable.splash);
        splashScreen.setScaleType(ImageView.ScaleType.CENTER_CROP);

        // Create a layout to hold the image view
        LinearLayout layout = new LinearLayout(this);
        layout.setLayoutParams(new LayoutParams(LayoutParams.MATCH_PARENT, LayoutParams.MATCH_PARENT));
        layout.addView(splashScreen);
        setContentView(layout);

        // ... existing code ...
    }

    // ... existing code ...
}
Build and run your app: After making these changes, build and run your app on an Android device or emulator to see the splash screen.
This should correctly set up the splash screen in your bare minimum React Native project without any errors.



User
cannot find symbol
    ImageView splashScreen = new ImageView(this);
    ^
  symbol:   class ImageView

ChatGPT
Apologies for the confusion earlier. If you are getting a "cannot find symbol" error for ImageView, it means the class is not being imported correctly. The ImageView class is part of the Android framework, so you should have access to it in your Android project.

Please ensure that you have the correct import statement for ImageView in your MainActivity.java file:

java
Copy code
import android.widget.ImageView;
If the error persists, double-check the following:

Confirm that the MainActivity.java file is located in the correct directory: android/app/src/main/java/com/yourprojectname/.
Check for any other syntax errors or typos in your code.
Verify that your project's dependencies are correctly set up, and there are no issues with the build process.
If you still encounter issues after verifying the above points, please share more details or the entire MainActivity.java file so that I can assist you further.



User

ChatGPT
Apologies for the oversight. If you're encountering a "cannot find symbol" error for LinearLayout, it means the class is not being imported correctly.

The LinearLayout class is also part of the Android framework, and you should have access to it in your MainActivity.java file.

Please ensure that you have the correct import statement for LinearLayout in your MainActivity.java file:

java
Copy code
import android.widget.LinearLayout;
If the error persists, please check the following:

Confirm that the MainActivity.java file is located in the correct directory: android/app/src/main/java/com/yourprojectname/.
Verify that your project's dependencies are correctly set up, and there are no issues with the build process.
If you are still encountering issues after verifying the above points, please share more details or the entire MainActivity.java file so that I can assist you further.

                               ^
  symbol:   class LayoutParams

ChatGPT
Apologies for the confusion once again. The error is due to the incorrect import statement for the LayoutParams class. The correct import statement for LayoutParams is different depending on whether you are using android.view.View or android.widget.LinearLayout.

For LinearLayout, you should use android.widget.LinearLayout.LayoutParams, and for View, you should use android.view.ViewGroup.LayoutParams.

Since we are dealing with LinearLayout, the correct import statement should be:

java
Copy code
import android.widget.LinearLayout.LayoutParams;
Make sure you have this import statement at the top of your MainActivity.java file, and the error should be resolved.

Again, I apologize for the oversight, and I hope this clears up the issue. If you encounter any further issues or have any more questions, please feel free to ask.



User
I've followed you but still my splash.png is not loaded as splash screen instead I see expo default splash screen

ChatGPT
I apologize for the inconvenience you are facing. If the Expo default splash screen is still appearing instead of your custom splash screen, there might be a few things to check:

Confirm the image location: Double-check that your splash.png image is placed in the correct location within your project. For Android, it should be in the android/app/src/main/res/drawable directory.
Verify the image name: Ensure that the image is named exactly as "splash.png" (all lowercase) for both iOS and Android.
Check app.json configuration: In the app.json file, verify that the splash section is correctly configured, pointing to the correct image path. Also, ensure that there are no typos or errors in the app.json file.
Clear cache: Sometimes, the Expo client might cache the previous version of the app, including the splash screen. Try clearing the Expo client's cache by running expo r -c (or expo start -c).
Build a new APK/IPA: If you are testing on a real device, the Expo client might not always update immediately. Try building a new APK/IPA and install it directly on the device to see if the custom splash screen appears.
Check native code changes: Ensure that you have saved and correctly applied any changes you made in the native code (e.g., MainActivity.java for Android).
Update Expo: Make sure you are using the latest version of Expo CLI by running npm update -g expo-cli.
Test on a real device/emulator: Sometimes, splash screens may not display correctly in the Expo Go app or the Expo client. Test your app on a real device or an emulator to see if the custom splash screen appears.
If you've checked all of the above and still face the issue, please double-check your project's structure and ensure that the changes are applied correctly. Also, make sure your Expo project is using the "bare minimum" workflow, as this approach requires some native code modifications.

If the problem persists, consider sharing your app.json, MainActivity.java, and any other relevant files so that I can take a closer look and provide more specific guidance.



User
I've applied your code but what happening now is expo splash screen does not update instead it use default expo splash screen also my app stack on splash screen

ChatGPT
I apologize for the inconvenience. If your app is stuck on the default Expo splash screen and not showing the custom splash screen, it might be due to various reasons. Let's try some troubleshooting steps to resolve the issue:

Clear Expo client cache: In the Expo Go app, try clearing the cache by shaking the device to open the developer menu. From there, select "Clear cache" and try running the app again.
Ensure Expo Go is up-to-date: Make sure you have the latest version of the Expo Go app installed on your device to ensure compatibility.
Ensure correct project setup: Double-check that you are using the "bare minimum" workflow in your Expo project and that the changes to the native code (MainActivity.java for Android) have been applied correctly.
Verify app.json: In your app.json file, make sure the splash section is correctly configured with the correct image path.
Check Android build: If you are testing on Android, make sure you have built and installed a new APK on your device instead of relying on the Expo client.
Check native code for errors: Review the changes made to MainActivity.java and ensure there are no syntax errors or issues with the native code.
Check for other errors: Look for any other error messages or warnings in the logs or console that might provide more information about what's causing the issue.
Try on a different device/emulator: Test the app on a different device or emulator to see if the issue persists.
If you have done all the above steps and still face the problem, please share your app.json, MainActivity.java, and any other relevant files. This will allow me to review the code and provide more specific help.

Thank you for sharing your app.json and MainActivity.java. From the code you provided, it seems like everything is set up correctly for the custom splash screen. The issue might be related to the Expo cache or the way the app is being built and launched.

Here are a few additional steps you can try to troubleshoot the issue:

Clear Expo client cache: In the Expo Go app, try clearing the cache by shaking the device to open the developer menu. From there, select "Clear cache" and try running the app again.
Clear Gradle cache: In your Android project's root directory, try running ./gradlew clean to clear the Gradle cache. Then, rebuild the Android app using expo run:android.
Verify the image file: Double-check that the splash.png file is in the correct location and has the correct name (all lowercase) in the assets directory.
Build and install APK: Instead of relying on the Expo client, try building an APK using expo build:android and install it directly on your Android device.
Test on a different device: If possible, test the app on a different Android device or emulator to see if the issue is specific to your current device.
Upgrade Expo CLI and client: Make sure you have the latest version of Expo CLI and Expo Go app installed on your device.
Remove unnecessary code: Temporarily remove any additional code related to the splash screen or customization to ensure there are no conflicts causing the issue.
Check Expo forum: Check the Expo forums and GitHub issues to see if there are any reported issues related to custom splash screens.
Test on iOS: If you have access to an iOS device, try running the app on iOS to see if the custom splash screen works as expected.
If, after trying the above steps, the issue persists, you can consider reaching out to the Expo community or creating a new issue on the Expo GitHub repository for further assistance.

Remember that updating your Expo project to the latest version might also bring improvements and fixes.

Is this error can cause problem to my splash screen issue here Problems loading reference 'https://schemastore.azurewebsites.net/schemas/json/package.json': Unable to load schema from 'https://schemastore.azurewebsites.net/schemas/json/package.json': getaddrinfo ENOTFOUND schemastore.azurewebsites.net.

ChatGPT
The error you mentioned is related to the inability to load a JSON schema file for the package.json in your project. This error generally doesn't have any direct impact on your custom splash screen not displaying correctly.

The error message suggests that the JSON schema file at 'https://schemastore.azurewebsites.net/schemas/json/package.json' cannot be loaded because the host 'schemastore.azurewebsites.net' cannot be resolved (ENOTFOUND). This issue is most likely related to your internet connectivity or the availability of the external server hosting the schema file.

Since this error is not directly related to the custom splash screen, resolving it might not fix the splash screen issue. However, it's still a good practice to ensure your network connection is stable and that there are no proxy or firewall issues preventing access to external resources.

To further troubleshoot the splash screen issue, focus on the steps provided earlier, such as clearing caches, verifying image locations, and testing on different devices. Additionally, consider checking the Expo forums or GitHub repository for known issues related to custom splash screens in the Expo bare minimum workflow.

If you encounter any other errors or issues, feel free to share more details, and I'll do my best to help you troubleshoot further.

how to clear cache by command in expo bare minimum

ChatGPT
In an Expo bare minimum project, you can clear the cache using the expo r -c command in the terminal or command prompt. This command is used to start your React Native project locally with the -c flag, which stands for "clear cache."

Here's how to do it:

Open your terminal or command prompt.
Navigate to the root directory of your Expo bare minimum project.
Run the following command:
r
Copy code
expo r -c
The -c flag will clear the Metro bundler cache and Expo's internal cache. This can be useful if you encounter issues related to caching, such as not seeing the updated changes or having problems with the custom splash screen.

After running the command, the project will be recompiled, and the cache will be cleared. You should now see the latest changes, including your custom splash screen, when you run your Expo bare minimum project.

Remember that this command is specifically for the Expo bare minimum project setup. If you are working on a different project type (e.g., "Managed" workflow), the command may vary.



User
after removing this suggested code LinearLayout layout = new LinearLayout(this);
    layout.setLayoutParams(new LayoutParams(LayoutParams.MATCH_PARENT, LayoutParams.MATCH_PARENT));
    layout.addView(splashScreen);
    setContentView(layout); now the the app does not stack on the splash screen but I'm still not seeing my custom splash screen I see the expo one

ChatGPT
I apologize for the confusion earlier. You are right; the code I suggested was not necessary and might have caused the issue with your custom splash screen not displaying correctly. It seems that removing that code allowed your app to move past the splash screen but did not show the custom splash screen as expected.

To troubleshoot further, please double-check the following:

Ensure the splash.png image is in the correct location within your project and that it has the correct name (all lowercase) in the assets directory.
Check your app.json file and verify that the splash section is correctly configured with the correct image path and other properties.
If you are testing on Android, try building an APK using expo build:android and install it directly on your Android device. This will ensure you are running the standalone app without relying on the Expo client.
Check the dimensions of your splash.png image and ensure it is suitable for different screen sizes and densities. You may need to provide different sizes for various Android devices.
Try testing the app on a different Android device or emulator to see if the issue is specific to your current device.
Make sure you have the latest version of Expo CLI and the Expo Go app installed on your device.
If you have access to an iOS device, try running the app on iOS to see if the custom splash screen works as expected.
If none of the above steps work, consider reaching out to the Expo community or creating a new issue on the Expo GitHub repository for further assistance.
Please make sure you have applied the necessary changes to the native code (e.g., MainActivity.java) as suggested in the previous responses. If you have any other questions or encounter any other issues, please let me know, and I'll be happy to help.

You suggested me to have one splash screen of this size 720x1280 but now you said "Check the dimensions of your splash.png image and ensure it is suitable for different screen sizes and densities. You may need to provide different sizes for various Android devices." DOES THIS MEAN I SHOULD HAVE MULTIMPLE 'splash.png' OF DIFFERENT DIMENSIONS?

ChatGPT
Yes, you are correct. I apologize for any confusion caused by my previous responses. To ensure that your custom splash screen looks good on various Android devices with different screen sizes and densities, it is recommended to provide multiple splash screen images of different dimensions.

Android devices come in various screen sizes and densities, and to avoid any scaling or cropping issues, you should provide splash screen images that match the different resolutions. This will help maintain the aspect ratio and visual quality of the splash screen on various devices.

Here's what you can do:

Prepare multiple splash screen images: Create different versions of the splash.png image, each with the appropriate dimensions for common screen sizes and densities. For example, you might have drawable-ldpi, drawable-mdpi, drawable-hdpi, drawable-xhdpi, drawable-xxhdpi, drawable-xxxhdpi, etc. directories in the android/app/src/main/res folder, and each of these directories will contain the respective splash screen image with the required dimensions.
Update the app.json: In your app.json file, you can specify the splash section with an array of images for different screen densities. Here's an example:
json
Copy code
{
  "expo": {
    "splash": {
      "image": [
        "./assets/splash_mdpi.png",
        "./assets/splash_hdpi.png",
        "./assets/splash_xhdpi.png",
        "./assets/splash_xxhdpi.png",
        "./assets/splash_xxxhdpi.png"
      ],
      "resizeMode": "contain",
      "backgroundColor": "#ffffff"
    }
  }
}
In this example, we have provided multiple images for different densities, and Expo will automatically pick the appropriate one based on the device's screen density.

Ensure image naming conventions: Make sure each image is named consistently, following the Android density qualifiers (e.g., splash_mdpi.png, splash_hdpi.png, etc.), so that Expo can properly select the right image for each device.
By providing multiple splash screen images for different screen densities, you can ensure a consistent and visually appealing splash screen experience across various Android devices.

Again, I apologize for any confusion caused earlier, and I hope this clears up the approach you should take for handling splash screens on Android devices with different resolutions. If you have any more questions or need further assistance, feel free to ask!

is there online splash generator to generate splash screens of these dimensions?

ChatGPT
As of my last update in September 2021, there were no official Expo-specific online splash screen generators. However, there are third-party tools and websites that can help you generate splash screens of various dimensions for your Expo project.

Keep in mind that Expo uses standard Android and iOS splash screen dimensions, so you can use any generic splash screen generator that supports these sizes. Here are a few options:

AppLaunchpad: AppLaunchpad is an online tool that allows you to create app screenshots, app icons, and splash screens for both Android and iOS. While it's primarily for screenshots, it also provides splash screen templates with various dimensions. You can check it out at: https://www.applaunchpad.io/
MakeAppIcon: Although the name suggests it's for app icons, MakeAppIcon also provides a Splash Screen Generator that allows you to upload your image and generate different sizes for Android and iOS. Check it out at: https://makeappicon.com/
AssetStudio: AssetStudio is not online, but it's an open-source project from Google that you can run locally. It allows you to generate various Android asset types, including splash screens, in different densities. You can find it on GitHub: https://github.com/google/android-studio/tree/master/asset-studio
When using these tools, make sure to follow the naming conventions for Android density qualifiers (e.g., drawable-mdpi, drawable-hdpi, etc.) and ensure that the generated images match the appropriate resolutions for different screen densities.

Remember that the most critical aspect is to maintain the correct aspect ratio and visual quality for your splash screens. Providing correctly sized images for different screen densities will ensure your custom splash screen looks great on various Android devices.

Before using any third-party tool, ensure that it's legitimate and trustworthy, and review any terms of service or usage policies associated with these tools.

As of the current date, there might be more tools available, so I recommend doing a quick search to find the most up-to-date and reliable options for generating splash screens for your Expo project.

is splash screen image should be .png?

ChatGPT
Yes, for most cases, the splash screen image should be in the .png format. Both Android and iOS support .png images for the splash screen.

Using .png format is a common practice because .png is a lossless image format, meaning it retains the highest quality possible. It supports transparency and is well-suited for images with solid colors or simple graphics, which is often the case for splash screens.

When using .png images for the splash screen, make sure to consider the following:

Image Quality: Use high-resolution images to ensure the splash screen looks crisp on various devices.
Image Size: Since splash screens are shown briefly when the app starts, it's important to strike a balance between image size and loading time. Avoid using excessively large .png images that might increase the app's initial load time.
Transparent Background: If your splash screen has a transparent background, the .png format is essential to preserve the transparency.
Remember that you may need to provide multiple versions of the splash screen image with different dimensions (for different screen densities) to ensure it displays correctly on various devices.

In summary, using .png format for the splash screen image is a standard and recommended practice, and it helps ensure that your splash screen appears correctly on both Android and iOS devices.

MainActivity.java:25: error: cannot find symbol
    splashScreen.setImageResource(R.drawable.splash);
                                            ^
  symbol:   variable splash

ChatGPT
The error message indicates that there is no resource with the name "splash" in the R.drawable namespace. This error typically occurs when the resource identifier specified in the setImageResource method does not match the actual resource name in your project.

To resolve this issue, follow these steps:

Verify the image name: Double-check that your splash screen image (e.g., splash.png) is located in the android/app/src/main/res/drawable directory of your project and that it has the correct filename, all lowercase, and without any spaces or special characters.
Check the generated R class: After adding the image to the drawable directory, rebuild your project (if you haven't already) to generate the R class, which contains references to all resources in your project. Ensure that there are no build errors during the build process.
Verify the image resource identifier: Once the R class is generated, check the R.drawable namespace for the correct identifier of your splash screen image. It should be something like R.drawable.splash if the image name is "splash.png".
Update the code: If the identifier is different from R.drawable.splash, modify the setImageResource method accordingly to match the correct resource identifier.
For example, if the identifier is R.drawable.my_custom_splash, the code should be:

java
Copy code
splashScreen.setImageResource(R.drawable.my_custom_splash);
After making the necessary adjustments, rebuild your project to ensure that the changes take effect.

Remember that the resource identifier in the R.drawable namespace should match the name of your actual splash screen image file (excluding the file extension). If it doesn't, that's likely the reason for the "cannot find symbol" error.
